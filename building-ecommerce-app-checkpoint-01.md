# Learning Journey: Building an Ecommerce Web App

## Checkpoint 1: Basic Homepage (Completed)

### What We Built
A professional-looking ecommerce homepage with:
- Clean navigation header
- Attractive hero section with gradient background
- Product grid displaying 3 items with images
- Interactive "Add to Cart" buttons
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes

### Files Created
- `index.html` - Main webpage structure
- `styles.css` - All styling and layout
- `building-ecommerce-app-checkpoint-01.md` - This documentation

### Key Learning Points

#### 1. HTML Structure (Foundation)
- Semantic HTML elements: `header`, `main`, `section`, `footer`
- Content organization with meaningful class names
- Linking external CSS files with `<link>` tag

#### 2. CSS Styling (Visual Appeal)
- **Layout**: CSS Grid for responsive product cards
- **Colors**: Professional color scheme using hex codes
- **Effects**: Hover animations and box shadows
- **Typography**: Font sizing and spacing for readability

#### 3. User Experience
- Sticky navigation that stays visible when scrolling
- Visual feedback on hover (buttons change color, cards lift up)
- Consistent spacing and alignment throughout

### Next Steps (Coming Soon)
- Add JavaScript functionality to make buttons work
- Implement shopping cart features
- Add more interactive elements

### Reflection
Starting with a complete visual demo helps understand the end goal before diving into individual concepts. This approach builds excitement and provides context for each technical skill we'll learn next.
